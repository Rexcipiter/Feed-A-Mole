    <h1>Recipe for Success:</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Have brilliant idea (probably while driving or in shower).</li>
    <li>Have torrent of world-shattering ideas compound with original idea.</li>
    <li>Panic because you realize have no way to actually record any of these ideas at the moment.</li>
    <li>Make desperate attempt to voice command a note to your phone knowing you're about to lose track of the entire train of thought.</li>
    <li>Be thankful you salvaged something out of the treasure trove of thoughts and fade back into annoyance at your lack of world-wide fame and fortune.</li>
  </ol>
